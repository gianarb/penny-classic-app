# Penny Classic Application
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pennyphp/penny-skeleton-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pennyphp/penny-skeleton-app)

This is a first [penny](https://github.com/gianarb/penny) implementation.
"Classic" because it integrates [league/plates](https://github.com/thephpleague/plates) and help you to build an HTML application.

## Installation
```
$ composer create-project penny/classic-app -s dev
$ cd classic-app
$ npm install
$ grunt dev
```

**Note:**  
bower and grunt require node.js this is only an example of method to manage static asset,
if you don't have familiarity with this tools no problem, you can use [assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic),
download all static deps into the public dir or other solutions.

## Built-in webserver

```bash
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public
```

it's ready! You can visit [127.0.0.1:8080](https://127.0.0.1:8080).

## Docker (NGINX/PHP-FPM)

**Attention**: This is a *development* environent due to how services are configured. If you want to use it in production
you have to: disable error reporting, persist logs, raise limits and fine tune your configurations.

This repository contains a `docker-compose.yml.dist` file which currently configures two containers, one
with the NGINX webserver and one with php-fpm. This file *must be renamed* into `docker-compose.yml` and modified
if you need something specific for your system like paths, ip addresses, ports and so on. Remember that the docker-compose.yml file
is ignored since this is very specific to the current installation.

### Requirements

- Docker >= 1.6.0
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Create your docker-compose.yml

```bash
$ cp docker/docker-compose.yml.development docker-compose.yml
# edit it for your specific needs
$ vi docker-compose.yml 
```

### Build
Before starting you have to build penny-classic specific images, to do it issue a:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

### Up and running

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Z-Ray

Z-Ray is included in the Penny Docker development environment.

### Endpoints

IP addresses can be configured in `docker-compose.yml`

- Application:  `http://127.0.0.10`
- Z-Ray:  `http://127.0.0.10:10081/ZendServer`

## Know how
This skeleton application not resolve ALL your problems and it's not perfect, this is a starting point and implementation example.
The penny's target is this! You are free to build your implementation, it made of experience and need.
